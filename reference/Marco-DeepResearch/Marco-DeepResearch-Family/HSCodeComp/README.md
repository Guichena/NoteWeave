## 📌 Overview

<div align="center">

**HSCodeComp** is the first realistic, expert-level e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate **deep search agents** on their ability to perform Level-3 knowledge—**hierarchical rule application**—a critical yet overlooked capability in current agent evaluation frameworks.

<div align="center">

The task requires agents to predict the exact **10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode)** for products described with **noisy, real-world e-commerce domain**, by correctly applying complex, hierarcahical tariff rules (e.g., from eWTP and official customs rulings). These rules often contain **vague language** and **implicit logic**, making accurate classification highly challenging. Our evaluation reveals a stark performance gap:

* 🔹 **Best AI agent (SmolAgent + GPT-5 VLM): 46.8%**
* 🔹 **Human experts: 95.0%**

Besides, ablation study also reveals that **inference-time scaling fails to improve the performance**. These highlight that deep search with **hierarchical rule application** remains a major unsolved challenge for state-of-the-art AI agent systems.

## 🔥 News
* [2025/10/] 🔥 We released the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631) and [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AIDC-AI/HSCodeComp) of our challenging HSCodeComp dataset.

## 📋 Dataset

![](assets/example_product_v3.png)
This figure reveals that the data format HSCodeComp dataset.

### Input

Each product $x \in \mathcal{X}$ contains rich information: $x = (t, A, c, i, p, u, r)$, where:
- **$t$**: Product title
- **$A = \{(k_j, v_j)\}_{j=1}^K$**: Set of $K$ product attributes (e.g., material, package size)
- **$c$**: Product categories defined by the e-commerce platform
- **$p$**: Price
- **$u$**: Currency

### Knowledge: Hierarchical Rules
The task requires agents to effectively utilize three types of e-commerce domain knowledge:
1. **Hierarchical tariff rules** from official classification systems (e.g., eWTP) with complex implicit logic and vague linguistic constraints.
![](assets/tariff_rule.png)
2. **Human-written decision rules** that specify how to correctly apply tariff rules
![](assets/human_decision_rule.png)
3. **Official customs rulings databases** (e.g., U.S. CROSS) containing historical HSCode classification decisions
![](assets/cross_example.png)

### Output

The HSCode $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ is a single **10-digit numeric string** $\mathcal{Y} \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,9\}^{10}$. The HSCode structure is hierarchical:
- **First 2 digits**: HS chapter
- **First 4 digits**: HS heading  
- **First 6 digits**: HS sub-heading
- **Last 4 digits (7-10)**: Country-specific codes

The 10-digit HSCode must follow a valid path in the official HS taxonomy. Please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631) for more details about these data.

### Dataset Collection and Statistic

![](assets/label_process_v4.png)
We engage several domain experts in HSCode prediction, and conduct a well-designed 6 steps pipeline to construct dataset. The important details of our proposed HSCodeComp is provided in following table.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Products** | 632 expert-annotated entries |
| **HS Chapters** | 27 chapters |
| **First-level Categories** | 32 categories |
| **Data Source** | Large-scale e-commerce platforms |
| **Validation** | Multiple domain experts |
| **Inter-annotator Agreement** | >98% |
| **Models Tested** | 14 foundation models, 6 open-source agents, 3 closed-source systems |
| **Knowledge Level** | Level 3: Hierarchical rule application |

## ⚙️ Quick Start

### 📁 Repository Structure

```bash
HSCodeComp/
├── data/
│   └── test_data.csv              # Product descriptions, attributes and ground-truth HSCodes
├── eval/
│   └── test_llm.py                # Evaluation script for model predictions
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

### 🛠️ Environment Setup

```bash

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv hscodcomp_env
source hscodcomp_env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# hscodcomp_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies (e.g., pandas, etc.)
pip install pandas,openai,tqdm,threading,dotenv

# set openai keys and base urls in HSCodeComp/.env
```

### 🚀 Run Evaluation

```bash
# Set models_to_test = ["gpt-4o"] in eval/test_llm.py
python eval/test_llm.py
```

The script reports **exact-match accuracy** at **2-digit, 4-digit, 6-digit, 8-digit, and 10-digit** levels.

## 📊 Benchmark Performance

### Complete Evaluation on HSCodeComp
![](assets/main_exp_result.png)

The top-performming baseline SmolAgent (GPT-5 with vision capability) achieves the best performance, while it still largely lags behind human expert performance.

<img src="assets/closed_source_main_exp_result.jpg" alt="Closed Source Main Exp Result" width="60%" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

Closed-source agent systems still largely underperform domain expert and open-source agent systems with GPT-5 backbone model.

### Current Agents Fail to Leverage Hierarchical Decision Rules

<img src="assets/fail_to_use_DR.jpg" alt="Closed Source Main Exp Result" width="75%" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

Performance degrades when human decision rules are included in the system prompt.


### More Thinking Leads to Worse Performance
<img src="assets/more_think_leads_to_worse_performance.jpg" alt="Closed Source Main Exp Result" width="75%" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

* More thinking leads to more errors and hallucinations in this highly domain-specific HSCode prediction task.
* When accurate information is available, through calling tools, prioritizing tool utilization over reasoning yields better results.

### Test-time Scaling Fails to Improve Performance
<img src="assets/tts.jpg" alt="Closed Source Main Exp Result" width="80%" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

Two kinds of inference-time scaling strategy (majority voting and self-reflection) fails to effectively improve the performance.
