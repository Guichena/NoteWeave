## 🧠 [UMEM](../UMEM/README.md)

**Unified Memory Extraction and Management for Generalizable Self-Evolving Memory**

<div align="center">
  <img src="UMEM/assets/umem_intro.png" alt="UMEM Framework" width="100%">
</div>

### Challenge

Build self-evolving agent memory systems that avoid the **"Rote Memorization" trap**—preventing accumulation of instance-specific shortcuts and noise that degrade generalization.

### Key Innovation

**Joint optimization** of memory extraction and management through a learned Mem-Optimizer policy that explicitly optimizes for cross-query generalization.

<div align="center">
  <img src="UMEM/assets/umem_overview.png" alt="UMEM Architecture" width="100%">
</div>

### Core Components

- 🔒 **Frozen Executor**: LLM/agent that solves tasks with retrieved memories
- 💾 **Evolvable Memory Bank**: Non-parametric key-value store updated over time
- 🎯 **Mem-Optimizer Policy**: Learned policy that outputs structured memory actions (ADD/UPDATE)

### Technical Highlights

- 🔬 **Semantic Neighborhood Modeling (SNM)**: Constructs semantic neighborhoods to evaluate memory updates across related queries
- 📊 **Marginal Utility Reward**: Neighborhood-level reward that optimizes for generalization
- 🔄 **GRPO + Online Evolution**: Commits best-reward actions to memory bank during training
- 📝 **Strict XML Schema**: Enforces format constraints to prevent answer leakage and hallucination

### Performance

- ✅ **Prevents overfitting** to single instances through neighborhood-level optimization
- ✅ **Generalizable memories** that transfer across semantically related queries
- ✅ **Efficiency gains** through trajectory length reduction while preserving correctness
- ✅ **Cumulative improvement** in streaming evaluation protocol
